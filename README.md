# Spring Boot Demo

## Intro

This project is my first one using Spring Boot. It lacks any realistic use cases, oly serving educational purposes.

## What I am attempting to learn

- Basic logic of Spring Framework
- Most important annotations
- Building a simple webserver with routes
- Generating some nice dogs
